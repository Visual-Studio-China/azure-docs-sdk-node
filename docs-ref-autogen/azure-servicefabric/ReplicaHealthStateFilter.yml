      Defines matching criteria to determine whether a replica should be
      included

      as a child of a partition in the cluster health chunk.

      The replicas are only returned if the parent entities match a filter

      specified in the cluster health chunk query description. The parent

      partition, service and application must be included in the cluster health

      chunk.

      One filter can match zero, one or multiple replicas, depending on its

      properties.
