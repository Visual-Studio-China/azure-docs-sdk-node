      A Job Release task to run on job completion on any compute node

      where the job has run.


      The Job Release task runs when the job ends, because of one of the

      following: The user calls the Terminate Job API, or the Delete Job API
      while

      the job is still active, the job's maximum wall clock time constraint is

      reached, and the job is still active, or the job's Job Manager task

      completed, and the job is configured to terminate when the Job Manager

      completes. The Job Release task runs on each compute node where tasks of
      the

      job have run and the Job Preparation task ran and completed. If you
      reimage

      a compute node after it has run the Job Preparation task, and the job ends

      without any further tasks of the job running on that compute node (and
      hence

      the Job Preparation task does not re-run), then the Job Release task does

      not run on that node. If a compute node reboots while the Job Release task

      is still running, the Job Release task runs again when the compute node

      starts up. The job is not marked as complete until all Job Release tasks

      have completed. The Job Release task runs in the background. It does not

      occupy a scheduling slot; that is, it does not count towards the

      maxTasksPerNode limit specified on the pool.
