      A machine resource represents a discovered computer system. It can be

      *monitored*, i.e., a Dependency Agent is running on it, or *discovered*,

      i.e., its existence was inferred by observing the data stream from
      monitored

      machines. As machines change, prior versions of the machine resource are

      preserved and available for access. A machine is live during an interval
      of

      time, if either its Dependency Agent has reported data during (parts) of

      that interval, or a Dependency agent running on other machines has
      reported

      activity associated with the machine.
