      The response body contains the status of the specified asynchronous

      operation, indicating whether it has succeeded, is in progress, or has

      failed. Note that this status is distinct from the HTTP status code
      returned

      for the Get Operation Status operation itself. If the asynchronous
      operation

      succeeded, the response body includes the HTTP status code for the

      successful request. If the asynchronous operation failed, the response
      body

      includes the HTTP status code for the failed request and error information

      regarding the failure.
