      List of network mappings. As with NetworkMapping, it should be possible to

      reuse a prev version of this class. It doesn't seem likely this class
      could

      be anything more than a slightly bespoke collection of NetworkMapping.
      Hence

      it makes sense to override Load with Base.NetworkMapping instead of
      existing

      CurrentVersion.NetworkMapping.
